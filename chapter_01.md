# Chapter 01
## why we write bad code?
- felt didn't have time to do good job
- boss would be angry if i took more time to clean up code
- maybe you notice the parts of code that need to be cleaned up but you ignore it to can complete work quickly and say it's done as fast as possible

## the total cost of owning mess
- if there is a company that grow quickly at first
- it will stuck on snail's pace
- every change thay make will make them break two or three parts of code, that is a bad thing i should only update one place at once
- as mess builds, productivity will decrease
- even if i choose very good developers to update that mess code and clean it, it will ends up with zero productivity
- everyone on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. So they all make more and more messes

## the primal conudruum
- you will not make deadline by making mess
- mess will slow you down 
- the only way to make deadline is, is to go fast, is to keep code clean all the time

## notes on clean code according to some developers qoutes
- single responsibility
- change only one part of code
- clean code is straightforward
- there is a difference between code easy to read and code easy to change
- code without tests is not clean
- smaller code is better
- clean code always looks like it is written by someone who cares
### rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code:
- Runs all the tests;
- Contains no duplication;
- Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
- Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like
